It seems Kai Havertz has turned into Pele in the eyes of Arsenal fans since he has been sidelined by a hamstring injury.

All of a sudden Havertz is a world-beater, that they cannot cope without, when in reality he has been panned by them for his inconsistent finishing since he joined.

But, with Gabriel Jesus already out injured for the season, Havertz's absence will give Arsenal fans an excuse if they end up not winning anything this campaign, and there will be a pile-on to ask why they did not sign another striker.

The fact Gunners boss Mikel Arteta tried to get Ollie Watkins from Aston Villa in January tells you he wanted someone in.

Now, if they don't win the league, there will be this blame game. Is it Arteta's fault, or is it on the board for not backing him?

Still, even with Havertz out, and Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli both injured too, I think Arsenal will have enough to beat Leicester. Leandro Trossard will probably lead their attack, although Raheem Sterling can also play up there.

Leicester are out of the FA Cup and were walloped by Everton in their last Premier League game.
